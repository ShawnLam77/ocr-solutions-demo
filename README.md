# AWS
Under the AWS folder, there are three .py files, each capable of recognizing forms, plaintext, and tables in images. Before running them, you need to:

    1. Create an AWS IAM account and grant necessary permissions from the root user to the IAM user.

    2. Install and configure the AWS CLI and the AWS SDKs.

    3. Upload the images to an AWS S3 bucket. 
    
Detailed instructions for all three steps can be found here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/textract/latest/dg/examples-blocks.html.
